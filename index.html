  <h2>Korean Legend Footballers</h2>
  <p>
  When it comes to Asian teams in the World Cup, South Korea hold the bragging rights. They have appeared in the tournament more times than any other team from the continent, while their run to the semi-finals when co-hosting the 2002 edition is the best performance from any Asian side.
  They won't have fond memories of their first appearance at the finals, however, as they were thrashed 9-0 by a Ferenc Puskas-inspired Hungary before being beaten 7-0 by Turkey in their second and final group game.
  They have since adapted to life on the grandest stage, however, and this summer's trip to Brazil will be the eighth time in a row that they have participated in the tournament.
